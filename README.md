# Tanuki and Max: My 0 to 1 Journey

Welcome to **tanuki-max-zero-one**, a weird little web app I’m building as a tribute to PostHog’s culture, Charles Cook, and my own journey from GitLab’s Tanuki to PostHog’s Max the Hedgehog.  

**Why this project?**  
Because *Zero to One* says the next step in tech comes from bold, weird leaps and not from doing what everyone else does. Charles inspired me to pick up my first book in quite some time (*Zero to One*), and this is my way of showing that I don’t just read about 0 to 1 but I *build* it.  


## What’s Inside?
- **Transparency Meter:** A slider proving that PostHog is 110% more transparent than Tanuki (sorry GitLab my first love).
- **Fake Commit History:** Because “git commit -m 'Added Max's shades of transparency.'” is a real feature.
- **0 to 1 Playground:** My take on *Zero to One*, AI, ChatGPT, and vibe coding in 2025.
- **Charles-in-Serbia Easter Eggs:** Ajvar, interior design inspiration, and questionable sandwich humor.

-

## My 0 to 1 Story
- Started at **GitLab** — right out of high school, hired by Sid (CEO) to run Reddit, Hacker News, and Twitter for GitLab.  
- **Respondo** — founded a startup that centralized developer feedback across social/forums (think Tanuki with superpowers).  
- **Humanitec** — closed €780K ARR with inbound platform engineering users. Learned that engineers love transparency (and hate BS).  
- **PostHog (Next):** Max the Hedgehog is basically Tanuki 2.0 — more transparent, more fun, and way weirder.

## Why This Repo Exists
If PostHog has a HogFlix 3000 demo for its sales team, this is my *personal* demo:  
- A creative resume.  
- A cultural fit story.  
- A love letter to weird, open-source-inspired products.

## Roadmap
**Day 1:** Basic layout, Transparency Meter, README draft.  
**Day 2:** 0 to 1 Page, Fake Commit Log, AI jokes.  
**Day 3:** Charles Cook Easter eggs (Serbia, sandwiches, interior design mode).  
**Day 4:** Deploy to GitHub Pages/Vercel with final “See you on Superday, Max!” note.
**Day 5:&** ONE HEDGHOG TO RULE THEM ALL!
